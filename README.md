# Amsterdam Schema

This repository contains a work-in-progress version of the Amsterdam Schema. Currently, Amsterdam Schema is a set of [JSON Schemas](https://json-schema.org/) and meta-schamas. The goal of this project is to describe and validate [open data published by the City of Amsterdam](https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/api/). Amsterdam Schema will be used to make the import, storage and publishing layers of our APIs more generic, easier to maintain, and better documented.
