# Amsterdam Schema

Amsterdam Schema aims to describe and validate
[open data published by the City of Amsterdam](https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/api/),
in order to make the storing and publishing
of different datasets more structured,
simpler and better documented.

This repository contains [JSON Schemas](https://json-schema.org/) and meta-schemas
that can make sure every dataset published by the City of Amsterdam
always contains the right metadata and is of the right form.

This repository contains:

1. A JSON Schema to validate dataset metadata;
2. A JSON Schema to validate table metadata;
3. A JSON Schema _metaschema_ to validate the JSON Schema that describes table data.

## Amsterdam Schema Specification

Apart from the technical description
an in-depth textual specification of the Amsterdam Schema can be found at
https://schemas.data.amsterdam.nl/docs/ams-schema-spec.html.

The Amsterdam Schema is chosen to be delimited in such a way
that it can interoperate with as many systems as possible.
The results of this analysis can be found at the
[Grootst Gemene Deler](https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam-schema/wiki/Grootst-Gemene-Deler) page.

## Amsterdam Schema Registry

Each instance of Amsterdam Schema exists of:

1. Metadata about a single dataset;
2. Metadata about each table in this single dataset;
3. For each table, a JSON Schema to describe and validate the data in these tables.

An overview of the current schemas can be found at
https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam-schema/tree/master/datasets.

## Concepts

In Amsterdam Schema, we're using the following concepts:

| Type       | Description                                        |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| Dataset    | A single dataset, with contents and metadata       |
| Table      | A single table with objects of a single class/type |
| Row        | A row in such a table (a single object, a row in a source CSV file or feature in a source Shapefile, for example) |
| Field      | A property of a single object                      |

For example:

- The dataset `bag` contains data for each building and address in the city;
- This dataset contains two tables: `buildings` and `addresses`;
- To describe this dataset according to Amsterdam Schema,
  we first describe the metadata of the dataset
  (such as its identifier, title, description and
  [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) fields) in a dataset.json file;
- For each table in this dataset,
  we describe the table metadata in a separate JSON file.
  We can also choose to combine the dataset and table JSON data in a single JSON file;
- For each table,
  we create a JSON Schema to describe its contents.
  This JSON Schema describes all the fields in a single table row, and the types of these fields;
- Amsterdam Schema is used to validate the dataset and table JSON data
- Amsterdam Schema is used to validate the table row JSON Schema,
  with a _meta-schema_ (a JSON Schema to verify a JSON Schema).

## Versioning

You can find all historical versions of the Amsterdam Schema definition in this repository.
Version numbers are shown as '@1.0.0'
where we follow SchemaVer for versioning.
This will allow for a gradual evolution of capabilities.

# Publishing

In order to publish the Amsterdam Schema to the object store
install the Python package included in this repository:

```console
% python3.8 -m venv venv
% pip install -U pip setuptools
% pip install '.[tests,dev]'
```

The extra options `tests` and `dev` are not strictly necessary for publishing,
but are handy to have installed while working on the schema definitions.
Once installed publishing could be as simple as running:

```console
% publish
```

but it likely isn't.

See, the `publish` tool expects a number of environment variables to be set.
These are:

```console
DATAPUNT_ENVIRONMENT=[acceptance|production|...]  # default is 'acceptance'
OS_USERNAME=dataservices
OS_TENANT_NAME=...
OS_PASSWORD=...
OS_AUTH_URL=https://identity.stack.cloudvps.com/v2.0
```

Where the `OS` prefix stands for Object Store,
and the `...` for values that you should provide.

For development purposes, it can be convenient to publish schemas
to an isolated development location on the objectstore.
The `schema:$ref` attributes will be set correctly during the publishing process.
This is essential for the validator in `schema-tools`
to follow the references to the metaschema during validation.

This development location is a `container` on the `dataservices` objectstore.

To create a new container, the `swift` commandline client can be used
(has been installed as part of `python-swiftclient`) that is a dependency.

Create new container with:

```console
% swift post <schemas-yourname>  # example name, remove <>
```

Now make this location read-accessible over HTTP with:

```console
swift post --read-acl ".r:*,.rlistings" <schemas-yourname>
```

Change the `SCHEMA_BASE_URL` environment variable to the http address
of the container you just created.

```console
SCHEMA_BASE_URL=https://<OS_TENANT_NAME>.objectstore.eu/<schemas-yourname>
```

The name of the objectstore container is constructed from 2 environment variables:
`$CONTAINER_PREFIX-$DATAPUNT_ENVIRONMENT`

The default value for `CONTAINER_PREFIX` is `schemas-`.


## Schema updates

New and/or updated schemas require a version bump of
the Python package and repository.
Strictly speaking things will,
at least currently,
still work without a version bump,
but we will lose track of what version of the Python package
published a specific set of schemas.

Find the current version number:

```console
% grep version setup.cfg
```

Say it has version `0.0.9`.
Now bump it to `0.0.10`:

```console
% tbump 0.0.10
```
